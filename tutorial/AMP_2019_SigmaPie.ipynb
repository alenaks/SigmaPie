    "**Chomsky hierarchy** aligns main classes of formal languages with respect to their expressive power.\n",
    "  * **Regular** grammars are as powerful as finite state devices or regular expressions: they can \"count\" only until certain threshold (no $a^{n}b^{n}$ patterns);\n",
    "  * **Context-free** grammars have access to potentially infinite _stack_ that allows them to reproduce patterns that involve center embedding;\n",
    "  * **Mildly context-sensitive** grammars are powerful enough to handle some types of cross-serial dependencies such as copying;\n",
    "  * **Context sensitive** grammars are restricted to a finitely long [memory tape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_tape) encoding the pattern;\n",
