    Methods:
        sl_to_fsm: converts given SL grammar to FSM transitions;
        scan_sl: scans a string with SL dependencies and tells
            whether it is well-formed in the current FSM;
        trim_fsm: removes useless transitions, i.e. the ones that

            that do not lead to the final state.
