# Python package for subregular language processing

In this repository, you can find a package for subregular language processing.
Please find below brief instruction on what is consists of (for now), and how to use it.
In order to get access to the language classes and methods defined for them, please run the following commands in the terminal after downloading the folder `slp`.
Please ensure that you are running `Python3`, no earlier than the version 3.6.

```python3
cd ~/slp
python3
from main import *
```

## Tools for strictly local (SL) languages
SL languages are generated by SL grammars.
The core idea behind SL grammars is to allow or to prohibit substrings up to a certain length in the generated language.
Grammars that prohibit illicit substrings are *negative*, and the ones that list allowed substrings are *positive*.

Initialize positive or negative SL grammar:

```python3
    posSL = PosSL()
    negSL = NegSL()
```
Initialize grammar or data sample:



## Tools for tier-based strictly local (TSL) languages 
TSL languages are generated by TSL grammars.
For this type of languages, the notion of a *tier* is crucial.
For every word, its tier consists of an image of this word under the erasing function, when all symbols in this word that are not included in the tier alphabet are being erased.
This approach allows to view long-distance processes as local by ignoring all the intervening material.

Initialize positive or nrgative TSL grammar:

```python3
    posTSL = PosTSL()
    negTSL = NegTSL()
```
